								<section>

								<p> I am a DPhil (PhD) student
									in Chemistry at the University of
									Oxford. My principal supervisor is
									<a href="https://www.brennanresearchgroup.com/">Professor Paul Brennan </a> at
																		 the
									   <a href="https://www.cmd.ox.ac.uk/">Centre
										   for Medicines Discovery</a> (CMD), and I am
									co-supervised by <a
											href="https://fduartegroup.org/">Dr Fernanda
										Duarte</a> in
									the Theoretical & Physical Chemistry
									Laboratory. My research sits in the
									broad field of medicinal chemistry,
									specifically looking at
									integrating computational
									methodology into drug
									discovery pipelines to streamline the
									search for new small-molecule
									therapeutics. My DPhil is funded through
									an <a
											href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/">
										EPSRC
									</a> studentship, and is also
									generously supported by <a
											href="https://www.exscientia.ai/">Exscientia</a>.
								I am a member of St Peter's College, and
									sang until 2023 in the <a
											href="https://www.merton.ox.ac.uk/choir">Merton College Choir</a>.
								</p>

									<p>
								I studied for my BA & MSci in Natural
									Sciences at Gonville & Caius College in
								the University of Cambridge, specialising
									for the latter two years in chemistry
									and chemical biology. My MSci project
									in the group of the late <a
											href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ca26">Professor Chris Abell FMedSci FRS</a>
									was titled 'Fragment Based Approaches
										to Targetting MurB from
										<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>', and
										developed a series of potent,
										lead-like compounds as part of a
										large collaborative effort to
										develop new antibiotic therapies for
										Cystic Fibrosis patients. I
										also undertook a summer project
										with <a
											href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/the-barnard-group/">Dr Anna Barnard</a>
									at Imperial College London. Whilst at
										Cambridge I coxed CUBC Blue Boats
										to victory in the 2017 and 2019
										Boat Races against Oxford, and
										held until 2022 the Women's Boat Race course
										record. I was also a
										countertenor choral
										scholar in the <a
											href="https://www.gonvilleandcaiuschoir.com/">Gonville & Caius College Choir</a>,
									with whom I sang at the funeral of
										Professor Stephen Hawking FRS, and
										other large concerts in Cambridge
										and beyond.
									</p>

									<p>
										Before Cambridge I studied at
										Westminster School in Central London
										for 5 years, rowing with the
										Westminster School Boat Club and
										singing in the school choir. I am a
										British Rowing Multi-Lane Umpire, and am
										involved in organising large-scale
										rowing events including <a
											href="https://www.shorr.org.uk/">The
																   Schools'
										Head of the River Race</a> and <a
											href="https://themarlowregatta.com/">
											Marlow
										Regatta</a>. I
										also
										sit on	The
										Boat Race Umpires Panel, and am a
										freelance commentator for BBC Sport, where I have commentated and presented the
										Boat Races for BBC One since 2021.
